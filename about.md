I am a PhD-student at the Robotics, Perception, and Learning lab (RPL) at KTH
Royal Institute of Technology. My interest is in Machine Learning, lately for
manipulation and perception for robotic usecases. I hold a Bachelor's degree in
Computer Science and a Master's in Machine Learning.


This blog is more or less intented as an online notebook to write down stuff like ideas coming
out of sudden bursts of creativity.
